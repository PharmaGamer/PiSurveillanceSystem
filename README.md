# PiSurveillanceSystem
Program for RPi Zero 2 W and camera with PIR motion sensor

Requirements:
  Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
  Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 (or any others that you like and are compatible with the RPi Zero 2 W)
  HC-SR501 PIR sensor with signal connected to GPIO 23
  
I'm working out how to put this all in a neat and tidy case.
